This package is a compatibility layer for various distributions. Its purpose
is to provide each distro with a set of local components which are commonly
needed to build various packages, or toolchains. Some tools are specific to
formilux (eg: flx), while others are provided as alternative to incompatible
versions shipped with certain distros (eg: sudo which clears the environment,
or bogus make-3.82, etc...).

In order to use it, just run "./build.sh --dist <your-distro>" and pick one
distro from the dist/ directory. Alternatively you can use --from to force
using a specific list of packages. Read the script for more information.
