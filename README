This package is a compatibility layer for various distributions. Its purpose
is to provide each distro with a set of local components which are commonly
needed to build various packages, or toolchains. Some tools are specific to
formilux (eg: flx), while others are provided as alternative to incompatible
versions shipped with certain distros (eg: sudo which clears the environment,
or bogus make-3.82, etc...).

In order to use it, just run "./build.sh --dist <your-distro>" and pick one
distro from the dist/ directory. Alternatively you can use --from to force
using a specific list of packages. Read the script for more information.

By default, the script will only build packages and not install them. You need
to pass "--install /path/to/destination" to install the resulting executables.
It is also possible to install after building without rebuilding everything.
For this, please pass "--reuse" to reuse the previously built executables
during the installation phase.

The build scripts are compatible with bash back to old versions (at least
2.05b). They also are also compatible with ksh. However, they are not strictly
OSIX so they explicitly reference /bin/bash. If your system has bash at a
different location or uses ksh instead, the only files which need to be changed
strictly speaking are build.sh and scripts/get_cached_file. The other files are
only sourced and will not really depend on the shell.

If some of the sources are already available somewhere, simply pass the list of
directories to look into in the FLX_SRC_CACHE_DIRS variable.

Example :

  $ mkdir -p /opt/flx2/bin
  $ FLX_SRC_CACHE_DIRS=/cache/src \
       ./build.sh --dist centos6 --install /opt/flx2/bin

The build directory may be removed using --clean. The downloaded files are stored
into the download directory, which is not cleaned using --clean. In order to also
clean it, use --distclean instead.
